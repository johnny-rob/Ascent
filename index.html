                <h4>An energy bar that actually tastes good</h4>
                <p>Ascent was created in Chattanooga, Tennessee in an effort to create a snack bar
                that was both healthy and actually tasted good.  Using lots of natural ingredients and no
                additional perservatives, Ascent bars are great to have on hand during a hike, climb, paddle or
                just to help get you through the work day.  We believe in crafting every bar with the intention
                of it being the best bar you have ever eaten.  So grab one today.</p>
